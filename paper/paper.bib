    abstract = {In recent years, it has been realized that low and ultra-low field (mT–nT magnetic field range) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used for molecular structural analysis. However, spectra are often hindered by lengthy acquisition times or require large sample volumes and high concentrations. Here, we report a low field (50 μT) instrument that employs a linear actuator to shuttle samples between a 1 T prepolarization field and a solenoid detector in a laboratory setting. The current experimental setup is benchmarked using water and 13C-methanol with a single scan detection limit of 2 × 1020 spins (3 µl, 55M H2O) and detection limit of 2.9 × 1019 (200 µl, 617 mM 13C-methanol) spins with signal averaging. The system has a dynamic range of \&gt;3 orders of magnitude. Investigations of room-temperature relaxation dynamics of 13C-methanol show that sample dilution can be used in lieu of sample heating to acquire spectra with linewidths comparable to high-temperature spectra. These results indicate that the T1 and T2 mechanisms are governed by both the proton exchange rate and the dissolved oxygen in the sample. Finally, a 2D correlation spectroscopy experiment is reported, performed in the strong coupling regime that resolves the multiple resonances associated with the heteronuclear J-coupling. The spectrum was collected using 10 times less sample and in less than half the time from previous reports in the strong coupling limit.},

The structures in the curve can be used to estimate the 14N nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) frequencies of the material. Density functional theory predictions of the NQR parameters of several fentanyl citrate compounds are also reported. The predictions for the aniline nitrogen are consistent with structures in the observed T1 data. To help interpret the fentanyl citrate results the T1 dispersion curve for the explosive ammonium nitrate is also presented.}

abstract = {DNP-NMR and EPR experiments that operate at or greater than L-band (i.e., ν0(e−) = 1–2 GHz) are typically limited to maximum sample volumes of several hundred µL. These experiments rely on well-known resonator designs for DNP/EPR irradiation such as the loop-gap resonator and Alderman-Grant coil, where their maximum volumes limit further application to imaging experiments and high-throughput screening beyond L-band. Herein, we demonstrate a birdcage (BC) resonator design that can accommodate several mL of sample while operating around 1.5 GHz. The sample volume is maximized by using two identical BC resonators in a stacked configuration. Simulations are used to optimize the BC design and the performance is validated experimentally with liquid-state Overhauser-DNP-NMR experiments. This BC design exploits just the parasitic capacitance of conductive rings and features no fixed tuning capacitors. An enhancement of −77 is achieved on a 10 mM 4-Amino-TEMPO in H2O sample for a 5 mL sample volume. The associated sample heating is minimal due to the low-E-fields generated and the large sample mass with +3.4 K when driving 100 W for several seconds.}

abstract = {There is growing interest in using low-field magnetic resonance experiments for routine chemical characterization. Earth’s field NMR is one such technique that can garner structural information and enable sample differentiation with low cost and highly portable designs. The resulting NMR spectra are primarily influenced by J-couplings, resulting in so-called J-coupled spectra (JCS). Many small molecules include atoms with NMR-active nuclei that are quadrupolar either at natural abundance or are often isotopically enriched (e.g., 2H, 6Li, 11B, 14N, 17O, etc.) where the effects of quadrupolar J-couplings and relaxation on JCS of strongly- and weakly-coupled spin systems have not been explored to date. Herein, using a set of seven fluoropyridine samples with unique substitution and J-couplings, we demonstrate that the 14N relaxation rates can induce drastic line-broadening in the JCS. This includes a previously unexplored unique line broadening mechanism enabled by strongly coupled spins at low-field. Numerical simulations are used to model and refine the magnitudes and signs of J-couplings, as well as indirectly determine the 14N relaxation rates in a single 1D experiment that has a higher fidelity than observed in high-field NMR experiments.}

    abstract = {Synthetic opioids, chiefly fentanyl, are responsible for nearly 70\% of global annual drug deaths due to their extreme toxicity, ease of manufacture, and addictiveness. We show the magnetic resonance technique of nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy can be used for the standoff detection of fentanyl hydrochloride (HCl), likely the most common illicit synthetic opioid, even through opaque packaging such as cardboard, plastic, and glass. Combining work in synthesis, crystallography, density functional theory, and nuclear magnetic resonance, we report the electric field gradient tensor parameters of the  14N and  35Cl nuclei in fentanyl HCl to determine the chemically specific NQR frequencies. We directly observe the NQR signal for the aniline nitrogen and measure the associated relaxation times. The results show a robust ability for the standoff detection of relevant quantities of fentanyl HCl, at room temperature, with an inexpensive system.},
